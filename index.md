## üé§ Stage shows

I perform shows and give talks on maths and science for kids and adults.

> "I worked with Steve on a large awards event. Steve engaged with the audience perfectly, delivered a continuously high level of energy, enthused the audience and did it all with a great sense of humour."

> "A brilliant presentation, easy to follow and understand and very engaging but really quite original."

You can [book me for your event](/contact).

You'll also find me performing science comedy shows with [Helen Arney](http://helenarney.com/) and [Matt Parker](http://standupmaths.com/) as [Festival Of The Spoken Nerd](https://festivalofthespokennerd.com/).
