## How to pay your parking fine if you've lost your parking ticket (PCN)

I've made this page in the hope that anyone searching online for help will find it!

I lost my PCN (Parking Charge Notice) after failing to pay for a ticket at a First Parking managed car park. There is no info online about what you should do in that scenario. So I fired off a load of emails to addresses that I just guessed at! The one that worked was:

admin@firstparking.co.uk

Email that address with your licence plate number and they will be able to fine the PCN and you'll then be able to pay online.
