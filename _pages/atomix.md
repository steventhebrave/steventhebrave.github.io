title: So you want to make a crystal lattice model
---
You're probably here because you asked me how I made the crystal lattice modal thing.

If you've only seen the Short you might want to watch the longer video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuL2yT-B2TM) as you can see the details more clearly.

It's three sheets of laser cut acrylic: two outer sheets, and a spacer sheet in between.

The resulting cavity is filled with about 3000 2mm ball bearings. The middle sheet of acrylic is also 2mm thick. That fit is too tight, so I added a few paper squares to each corner to make the cavity slightly thicker. You might be able to find a combination of ball size and acrylic thickness that doesn't require padding with little paper squares!

I used 5mm acrylic for the front and back but that was too thin as the whole think flexes way more than I would like. I don't know the best thickness but I would guess that 10mm would be fine.

The whole thing is held together with nuts and bolts in the corners. But you could use acrylic weld.

Here are the files I sent to the laser cutter:
